# 📊 Case Study: Leveraging Descriptive Statistics for Business Insights  

At **Dataquest Solutions**, we recently conducted an in-depth analysis of retail sales data using **descriptive statistics** to demonstrate how businesses can transform raw data into actionable insights.  

---

## 🔹 1. Data Overview  
We analyzed **9,994 transactions** from a Superstore dataset, containing variables such as:  
- Sales  
- Profit  
- Discount  
- Quantity  
- Category  
- Region  

---

## 🔹 2. Measures of Central Tendency (What’s typical?)  
- **Mean Sales:** \$229.86  
- **Median Sales:** \$54.49  
- **Mode Sales:** \$12.96  

> **Insight:** Relying only on averages can be misleading when large outliers exist. The **median** often better represents typical sales.  

---

## 🔹 3. Measures of Dispersion (How spread out is the data?)  
- **Range (min–max):** \$0.44 – \$22,638  
- **Standard Deviation (SD):** \$623.25  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** \$192.66  
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** 2.71  

> **Insight:** Sales are highly dispersed, suggesting inconsistent transaction sizes.  

---

## 🔹 4. Distribution Shape  
- **Skewness = 12.97** → Strong right skew (a few very large sales dominate)  
- **Kurtosis = 308** → Very peaked (heavy tails, extreme outliers)  

> **Insight:** A few big clients may disproportionately affect revenue.  

---

## 🔹 5. Frequency Distributions (Categorical Data)  
- **Office Supplies:** 60.3% of orders  
- **Furniture:** 21.2%  
- **Technology:** 18.5%  

> **Insight:** Most transactions involve office supplies, but higher-value opportunities lie in Technology and Furniture.  

---

## 🔹 6. Cross-Tabulations (Comparisons)  
**Category by Region** showed a consistent pattern:  
- Office Supplies ≈ 60% of sales in every region  
- Furniture ≈ 20%  
- Technology ≈ 18%  

> **Insight:** Category preferences are stable across geographies, useful for supply chain and inventory planning.  

---

## 🔹 7. Correlation & Associations  
- **Sales & Profit:** Weak correlation (discounting affects profits)  
- **Discount & Profit:** Negative correlation (higher discounts reduce profitability)  

> **Insight:** Aggressive discounting strategies may drive sales but harm long-term profit margins.  

---

## 🔹 8. Outlier Detection  
- **Boxplots & Z-scores** flagged extreme transactions in both **Sales** and **Profit**.  
- Outliers included both **large profitable orders** and **heavy losses**.  

> **Insight:** Monitoring outliers helps detect risky deals, fraud, or opportunities for premium customers.
